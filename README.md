The project FoodSha aims to tackle the issue of food waste, which is a significant problem in Sri Lanka. According to officials from the Waste Management Authority, an estimated 500 metric tons of food are discarded daily in the Western Province alone.And also the current food waste problem is causing a significant negative impact on our environment and economy. 

It's ironic that despite this, both food waste and hunger are increasing. This suggests that the issue isn't a lack of food but a lack of a way to connect the extra food with those who need it. To address this, we came up with a solution in the form of a mobile application that allows individuals, shops, and restaurants to donate, share, or sell their surplus food or leftovers at reduced prices. This will help feed those in need while reducing food waste. Using FoodSha, people can find nearby free or discounted food listings and collect them. 

The main objective of this project is to connect people with each other and with local businesses, so that surplus food can be shared or sold at reduced prices, rather than thrown away. The working principle of the app is simple: it works like Uber Eats, but for free. Once users sign up for FoodSha, they can discover available food listings, add food listings that they're willing to share, and post food requests.

The proposed mobile application will have two primary sets of users: food suppliers and food recipients. 
Food suppliers will include grocery stores, restaurants, and other types of food producers. These users 
will be able to use the application to list their excess food and establish a connection with those in need. 
On the other hand, food recipients will include local food banks, shelters, and other organizations that 
provide food to those in need. These users will be able to use the application to connect with food 
suppliers and access excess food.
